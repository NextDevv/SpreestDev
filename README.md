# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

Let me tell you who I am. I'm a game developer who loves to create fun and engaging experiences for players. I use kotlin as my programming language of choice, because it's concise, expressive and versatile. I also like to help people, whether it's by sharing my knowledge, giving feedback or collaborating on projects. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. That's me in a nutshell!
